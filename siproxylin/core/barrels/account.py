XMPPAccount - The master barrel that orchestrates all account functionality.

specialized barrels for different concerns:

- ConnectionBarrel: Connection management
- MessageBarrel: Message handling
- CallBarrel: Audio/video calls
- PresenceBarrel: Roster and presence
- FileBarrel: File transfers
- OmemoBarrel: OMEMO devices
- AvatarBarrel: Avatar management
